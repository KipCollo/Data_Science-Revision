# Data_Science-Revision

Data science is the discipline of the extraction of knowledge from data. It relies on computer science (for data structures, algorithms, visualization, big data support, and general programming), statistics (for regressions and inference), and domain knowledge (for asking questions and interpreting results).

Data science traditionally concerns itself with a number of dissimilar topics:-

1. Databases, which provide information storage and integration.
2. Text analysis and natural language processing, which let us “compute with words” by translating qualitative text into quantitative variables.
3. Numeric data analysis and data mining, which search for consistent patterns and relationships between variables.
4. Complex network analysis, which is not complex at all. It is about complex networks: collections of arbitrary interconnected entities.
5. Data visualization, which is not just cute but is extremely useful, especially when it comes to persuading your data sponsor to sponsor you again.
6. Machine learning (including clustering, decision trees, classification, and neural networks), which attempts to get computers to “think” and make predictions based on sample data.
7. Time series processing and, more generally, digital signal processing, which are indispensable tools for stock market analysts, economists, and researchers in audio and video domains.
8. Big data analysis, which typically refers to the analysis of unstructured data (text, audio, video) in excess of one terabyte, produced and captured at high frequency.
